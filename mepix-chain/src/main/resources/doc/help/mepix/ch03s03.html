            The MEPIX tool can also derive products which will are of interest within the O2 project. These are:
            </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">

                    Aerosol apparent pressure ('PScatt', LISE approach)
                </li></ul></div><p>
            The algorithms have been implemented based on the documentation and breadboard software
            provided by FUB and LISE. During two collocations the implementation was verified together with
            the algorithm developers.

                This algorithm was developed as IDL code by Free University of Berlin (FUB) and is described in
                [3]. The algorithm includes a new straylight correction scheme proposed by FUB (see [4]).
                Brockmann Consult provided a Java implementation in MEPIX. A validation with the original
                IDL code was performed by applying Junit tests on distinct test data provided by FUB.

                This algorithm was developed as FORTRAN code by LISE and is a slight extension of the TOA
                pressure using filter-dependent C coefficients. Brockmann Consult provided a Java
                implementation in MEPIX.

                This correction has been proposed by LISE to be applied on the TOA Pressure. This product
                is provided as additional band in MEPIX.
