<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
    The IdePix pixel classification tool provides a classification of pixels with respect to their underlying attributes,
    e.g. if the pixel is regarded as cloudy, as a snow or ice pixel, etc. Since separate algorithms are applied for the
    classification over water and land, the tool is also divided into user interfaces for water and land.
    Supported products are MERIS L1b for classification over water, and both MERIS and SPOT-VGT L1b for classification
    over land.
</p>

<h3>User Interfaces</h3>

<p>
    The IdePix Tool can be invoked from the VISAT tool menu by selecting
    the <b>IDEPIX Generic classification of pixels...</b> entry, or in batch mode by using the command line
    tool <i><code>gpt</code></i> (Graph Processing Tool) which is located
    in the BEAM <code>bin</code> directory.
</p>

<h3>Algorithms</h3>

<p>
    The IdePix tool for water pixel classification was developed in the frame of the ESA DUE project 'CoastColour' [1], and
    the ESA OceanColour CCI project [2]. The classification is mainly based on the algorithms described in [3], chapter 5.
</p>

<p>
    The IdePix tool for land pixel classification was developed in the frame of the ESA DUE project 'GlobAlbedo' [5], and
    the ESA LandCover CCI project [6]. The classification is mainly based on the algorithm described in [7].
