            MEPIX is a BEAM scientific processor for multiple use. In the short term, it is serving as an experimental
            platform to evaluate the new products which are derived from the exploitation of the oxygen
            band. This work is done in the context and funded by the ESA O2 project. In parallel that part of the
            MERIS L2 processing which is relevant for the pixel classification is also implemented in MEPIX.
            The objective is to test the standard MERIS pixel classification with the new pressure products.
            Furthermore, the pixel classification as developed in the GlobCover and AlbedoMap projects has been integrated
            in the MEPIX processor. The objective is to compare the standard L2 pixel classification
            with the GlobCover one. This work is done for the MERIS Data Quality Working Group, and is
            funded through the &#8220;Pixel Classification Processor&#8221; workpackage of the BEAM maintenance contract.
